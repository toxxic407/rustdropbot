# Rust Drop Bot
Bot that farms Twitch Drops for Rust

# Requirements: 

Chrome and a Twitch Account that is eligible for Drops and logged in on Chrome

# Usage:

1. Download the latest Release from the Releases Page and launch the Program
2. Paste in your Chrome Installation Path (i.e. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")
3. If you want to adjust the Program (i.e. edit watchtime or prevent the bot from viewing streamers whose drops you already have/dont want) edit the stats.json file and relaunch the program
4. If the Bot doesnt work try deleting the path.txt and stats.json files that are located in the same folder as the Program
5. If another Round of Twitch Drops has started you need to remove the old stats.json File before using the Program

# Important things to know about this Program:
1. The Bot doesn't claim the Drops for you it only completes the watchtime
2. I am not responsible for any Damage to your Computer/Bans from Twitch/Apocalyptical Events that might because you used this Program
